                <p class="title"> Hello there !</p> 

                <p> You are here to participate in a scientific experiment, in the context of the “Human in the Loop” class project from Mosig Master 2.</p>
                <p> The goal is to understand the effect of sound notification while a user is watching a video.  </p>
               
                <p>You will have to watch a video we selected entirely and you will receive notification at the same time. You will then have to answer a few questions about how you felt, and how the notification disturbed you (or not). </p>

                <p>Please try to pay attention to the video as much as possible. To do so, try to be in an isolated, quiet space while proceeding the experiment. Alos, try to understand the content of the video as much as you can. </p>

                <p> When you have read everything on this page, click on the button “Agree to the conditions” and click on the “Start” button </p>

                <p>Watch the video. Please, do not pause it! You have to be fully immersed ;)</p>
                
                <p>At the end, a pop-up will appear. Follow the link it gave to have access to the questionnaire, and fill it. The questionnaire is totally anonymous and no personal data is asked.               </p>

                <p>After that, you are done! Thank you a lot for participating !</p>
